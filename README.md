# Exercises: Research Data Management in Collaborative Projects

These exercises are part of the **FibReLoop** training program for doctoral candidates and are designed to complement the workshop on **Research Data Management (RDM)**. The focus is on developing practical awareness and collaborative skills for managing research data within a multi-partner, international project like FibReLoop.

The exercises aim to:
- Encourage reflection on the kinds of data you will generate in your own research,
- Identify opportunities and challenges in data sharing and reuse within the consortium,
- Develop a shared understanding of good practices in data documentation and metadata.

You will work in small groups and share your findings in short discussions. The [slides](rdm-fibreloop.pdf) from the workshop are also available in this repository.

## Exercise 1: Evaluating Dataset Documentation

- **Time:** 15 minutes
- **Group size:** 3–4 researchers

### Goal:
Assess the quality of metadata and documentation in a publicly available dataset. Discuss what makes the dataset easy (or difficult) to understand and reuse.

### Instructions:

1. As a group, explore one of the provided public datasets.
2. Use the questions below to guide your evaluation.
3. Prepare to share 1–2 strengths and 1–2 weaknesses you identified.

### Datasets:

- [Double cantilever beam tests on bi-material joints](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/20d2f4de-27a4-41ad-a73e-cba115826cb3/1)
- [Properties of self-healing thermoplastic polyurethane for printing](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/f9ae0125-dc97-4294-9529-917df2458a0b/1)
- [Numerical and experimental study of rail steels](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/bad723e5-c0ca-4725-a4c1-8314a41a046a/1)
- [Wave propagation in mechanical metamaterials](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/99ef8b67-86ea-4298-af82-578f7b244486/1)
- [Coating to enhance fiber-matrix adhesion in C/PPS](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/e48d3347-a0fd-486a-949b-5f2dd01b21f3/2)

### Evaluation Questions:

- **Clarity**: Is it clear what the dataset contains and what it is meant for?
- **Structure**: Is the data organized in a logical, consistent way?
- **Metadata**: Are key variables, units, methods, and formats described?
- **Documentation**: Is there a README or data descriptor? Is it up to date?
- **Context**: Can someone unfamiliar with the original project understand and use the data?
- **Licensing**: Is it clear what you are allowed to do with the data?
- **Standards**: Does the dataset follow any known standards (e.g. naming, file formats, metadata)?

### Optional reflection (if time allows):

- If you were to reuse this dataset in your project, what further information would you need?

## Exercise 2: Collaborative Data Management Planning

- **Time:** 30 minutes
- **Group size:** 3–4 researchers

### Goal:
Discuss how the research data generated in your individual projects could be made useful for others in the consortium, and identify requirements for collaborative data management.

### Part 1 – Understand Your Data (10–15 min)

Take turns briefly describing the kind of data you expect to generate in your project. Then discuss the following:

- What types of data will you work with? (e.g. numerical, textual, image-based, code, models, etc.)
- What would others in the consortium need from your data to make use of it?
- What data do expect from other researchers?
- Could your data be reused in another partner’s work package or task?
- Are there privacy, IP, or confidentiality issues?

### Part 2 – Plan for Collaborative RDM (15–20 min)

Based on your discussion, think together about the **requirements** for good collaborative data management in the project:

- What **file formats** would be suitable or should be avoided?
- How should data be **structured** to support interoperability?
- What kind of **metadata** should be included to make the data understandable?
- What **infrastructure** could you use for storage and sharing?
- How will you ensure **documentation** is clear and up to date?
- Are there **standards**, templates, or naming conventions you could agree on?

Write down key points or ideas. You’ll be asked to briefly share a few insights with the full group afterward.

### Optional prompt (if time allows)

What would help *you* most when trying to use someone else's data from this project?
